# States

## Basic usage

### 1. Extend States

**Using ViewModel:**

```kotlin
sealed class ExampleEvents : StatesOneTimeEvents {
    data object SnackBar : ExampleEvents()
}

data class ExampleViewState(val state: String)

class ExampleViewModel : StatesViewModel<ExampleViewState>(ExampleViewState("example")) {
    override fun registerStates() {
        super.registerStates() // this automatically registers default viewState
        registerCustomEvent<ExampleEvents>()
    }

    fun onStateClicked() = launchOnDefault {
        emitViewState {
            it.copy(state = it.state + "x")
        }
    }
}
```

**Using own screen models**

This can be used if you use for
example [Voyager](https://voyager.adriel.cafe/screenmodel/coroutines-integration).

```kotlin
sealed class ExampleEvents : StatesOneTimeEvents {
    data object SnackBar : ExampleEvents()
}

data class ExampleViewState(val state: String)

class ExampleScreenModel : States<ExampleViewState> {
    override fun getCoroutineScope(): CoroutineScope {
        // provide your coroutine scope which will be used by states to operate on
    }

    override fun getInitialViewState(): ExampleViewState {
        return ExampleViewState("example")
    }

    override fun registerStates() {
        // you have to manually register default viewState
        registerCustomViewState(getInitialViewState())
        registerCustomEvent<ExampleEvents>()
    }

    fun onStateClicked() = launchOnDefault {
        emitViewState {
            it.copy(state = it.state + "x")
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Observe state in your composable screens

Provide your viewModel or other Model solution extending States to your screen. Then you
can call observe methods to observe viewStates and Events.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun ExampleScreen(exampleScreenModel: ExampleScreenModel) {
    val vs = exampleScreenModel.observeViewState()

    exampleScreenModel.observeEvents<ExampleEvents>(onEvent = {
        when (it) {
            ExampleEvents.NavigateToAnotherScreen -> {
                //NavigateToAnotherScreen   
            }
        }
    })

    Text(
        modifier = Modifier.clickable { exampleScreenModel.onStateClicked() },
        text = "Hello ${vs.state}"
    )
}
```

### 3. Emitting viewState and events

You can use extension methods of States interface to emit events or viewState.
Emitting should happen inside a coroutine. You can use one of the provided methods to launch a
coroutine
for each action: **launchOnIo, launchOnDefault, launchOnUnconfined, launchOnMain,
launchOnMainImmediate**.

```kotlin
    fun example() = launchOnDefault {
    emitViewState {
        it.copy(state = it.state + "x")
    }
    emitEvent(ExampleEvents.NavigateToAnotherScreen)
    emitViewStateWithType<String> { "new State" }
}
```

## Advanced usage and topics

### Registering events and states

States are based on a map of streams and types. Each type that is registered with
`registerCustomViewState` or `registerCustomEvent` is stored
as a pair of KClass to Stream and can be observed by its type.
You can register multiple states and events.

### Testing

With `StatesTestManager` you can switch the scope of all launchOn* methods to main if you set
isRunningInTests to true.

**Turbine**
Most convenient method for testing is using [Turbine](https://github.com/cashapp/turbine) library.

```kotlin
findViewStateStreamByType<SideMenuViewState>()?.stream?.test {
    // testing here
}
```

**EmitterCollector**
Another way to test is using `EmitterCollector` in  `StatesTestManager`. This collector will collect
every state and event
that is emitted by States. You can implement your own `EmitterCollector` or use a ready
made `TestingEmitterCollector` and its extension functions.

```kotlin
TestingEmitterCollector.expectStatesOrEvents
TestingEmitterCollector.expectLatestStateOrEvent
```

### Searching for streams

If you need an access to a certain stream, you can find it with methods of
States `findViewStateStreamByType` and `findEventByType`.

### Getting last state

If you need an access to the last state, you can use `getLastState`.

### One time events

One time events are supported if you extend the interface `StatesOneTimeEvents`.

### Debugging and logging

If you need to enable logging for debug purposes, enable `StatesLogger.isStatesDebugModeEnabled`.

### Observing states and events

For observing states and events you can use one of the following methods.

```kotlin
observeEvents
observeViewState // for default States viewState type
observeViewStateAsState // for default States viewState type
observeViewStateWithType // for custom registered viewState
observeViewStateAsStateWithType // for custom registered viewState
```

### Emitting states and events

For emitting states and events you can use one of the following methods.

```kotlin
emitViewState // for default States viewState type
emitViewStateWithType // for custom registered viewState
emitEvent // for custom registered event
```

### Coroutine helpers

There are several helpers for coroutines.

**Launchers as extensions for States**

```kotlin
launchOnIo
launchOnDefault
launchOnUnconfined
launchOnMain
launchOnMainImmediate
```

**Launcher as extensions for CoroutineScope**

```kotlin
launchIO
launchDefault
launchMain
launchMainImmediate
launchUnconfined
```

**Context switchers**

```kotlin
withMainImmediate
withIO
withDefault
withMain
withUnconfined
```
